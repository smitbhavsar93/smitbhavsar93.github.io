# Smit's Website


This is my portfolio website that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Intially, the entire website was coded upon VSC, upon which I uploaded to GitHub and make minor changes here and there right here over on GitHub as changes will appear on the website in REAL-TIME! Also used Bootstrap Framework to incorporate open-source templates for UI Interface elements.
